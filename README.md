# Excel Data Analytics Projects

This repository contains my Excel-based data analytics and data cleaning projects.
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how I use Microsoft Excel to clean data,
analyze datasets, and extract meaningful insights relevant to a Data Analyst role.

Each project is stored in a separate folder with:
- The Excel file
- A dedicated README file

## Tools & Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, errors, duplicates)
- Formulas (XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, IF, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS)
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- Data Validation
- Basic Dashboards
- Conditional Formatting

## Project Structure
Each folder represents one independent project and includes:
- Raw or semi-raw data
- Cleaned / analyzed Excel workbook
- Project-specific README with details

## Why Excel?
Excel is widely used in business environments for quick analysis, reporting,
and decision-making. These projects reflect real-world scenarios where Excel
is often the primary tool.


More projects will be added as I continue learning and improving.
